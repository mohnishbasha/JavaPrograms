lossless data compression algoright
- there is no loss of the original
- symbols with higher frequency are encoded with less bits.
- symbols with less frequency are encoded with more bits
- David Huffman
- Wildly used for data compression - JPEG, PNG etc.

- Variable length encoding
-- provides substantial compression over fixed length encoding
