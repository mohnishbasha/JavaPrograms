/*
 * Tail recursion means, the last call in the recursive function is a call to
 * the function and there is nothing left to do when the recursive call returns.
 * Why tail recursion? With tail recursion it’s easy for the compiler to remove
 * the recursion and drop the growing stack. So with an optimized tail recursive
 * function you will not run out of stack space what you otherwise would quite
 * easily.

Update 2: The call stack for the recursive solution for “ABC” would be:

-> reverse(”ABC”)
-> reverse(”BC”) + ‘A’
-> (reverse(”C”) + ‘B’) + ‘A’
-> (”C” + ‘B’) + ‘A’
-> “CB” + ‘A’
-> “CBA”

and for the tail recursive version:
-> reverse(”ABC”, “”)
-> reverse(”BC”, “A”)
-> reverse(”C”, “BA”)
-> reverse(”", “CBA”)
-> “CBA”

/*
 * Comparing those two the first one increases the stack to a point until it
 * starts to pop the stack. The tail recursive version does not use the stack to
 * keep a “memory” what it has still to do, but calculates the result imediatly.
 * Comparing the source though, in my view the tail recursive version takes all
 * beauty out of the recursive implementation. It nearly looks iterative.
