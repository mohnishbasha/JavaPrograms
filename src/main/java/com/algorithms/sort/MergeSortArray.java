/*
 * 
 * Merge sort Main article: Merge sort Merge sort takes advantage of the ease of
 * merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. It starts by comparing
 * every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if
 * the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting
 * lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on;
 * until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the
 * algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large
 * lists, because its worst-case running time is O(n log n).
 */

/*
 * Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
 * 
 * If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise: Divide
 * the unsorted list into two sublists of about half the size. Sort each sublist
 * recursively by re-applying merge sort. Merge the two sublists back into one
 * sorted list. Merge sort incorporates two main ideas to improve its runtime:
 * 
 * A small list will take fewer steps to sort than a large list. Fewer steps are
 * required to construct a sorted list from two sorted lists than two unsorted
 * lists. For example, you only have to traverse each list once if they're
 * already sorted (see the merge function below for an example implementation).
