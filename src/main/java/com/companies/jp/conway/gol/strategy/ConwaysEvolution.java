        Evolution Rules:
        1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors	dies, as if	caused by underpopulation.
        2. Any live	cell with more than	three live neighbors dies, as if by	overcrowding.
        3. Any live	cell with two or three live	neighbors lives	on to the next generation.
        4. Any dead	cell with exactly three	live neighbors becomes a live cell.
        5. A cellâ€™s	neighbors are those	cells which	are	horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent. Most cells
        	will have eight neighbors. Cells placed on the edge	of the	grid will have fewer.
